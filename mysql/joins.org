* MySQL - LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN AND OUTER JOIN

If I do a regular JOIN (with none of the keywords INNER, OUTER, LEFT
or RIGHT), then I get all records that match in the appropriate way in
the two tables, and records in both incoming tables that do not match
are not reported:

If I do a LEFT JOIN, I get all records that match in the same way and
IN ADDITION I get an extra record for each unmatched record in the
left table of the join 


If I do a RIGHT JOIN, I get all the records that match and IN ADDITION
I get an extra record for each unmatched record in the right table of
the join 


An INNER JOIN does a full join, just like the first example, and the
word OUTER may be added after the word LEFT or RIGHT in the last two
examples - it's provided for ODBC compatibility and doesn't add an
extra capabilities.
