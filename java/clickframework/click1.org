* Click Frame Work

Click is a simple J2EE web application framework for commercial java
developers, this is an opene source project, licensed under the
Apacehe foundation.

Click uses an event based programming model for prcessing Servlet
requests and Velocity for rendering  the response, other templating
engine like JSP and Freemarker are also supported.

This framework uses a single servlet, called ClickServlet to act as a
request dispatcher. When a request arrives ClickServlet creates a Page
Object to process the request and then use the page's velocity
template to render the results.
