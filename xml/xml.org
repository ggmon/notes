** CDATA

The term CDATA is used about text data that should not be parsed by
the XML parser.Characters like "<" and  "&" are illegal in XML
elements. "<" will generate an error because the parser interprets it
as the start of a new element.

"&" will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the
start of an character entity. Some text, like JavaScript code,
contains a lot of "<" or "&" characters. To avoid errors script code
can be defined as CDATA.Everything inside a CDATA section is ignored
by the parser.

A CDATA section starts with "<![CDATA[" and ends with "]]>":
