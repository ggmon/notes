* Video Capture on Android

** Supported Formats
   
   IN general Androidâ€™s support is consistent with other mobile phones. It supports the 3GP
   (.3gp) and MPEG-4 (.mp4) file formats. 3GP is a video standard derived from MPEG-4
   specifically for use by mobile devices.

   As far as codecs go, Android supports H.263, a codec designed for low-latency and
   low-bitrate videoconferencing applications. H.263 video is supported in either MPEG-4
   (.mp4) or 3GP (.3gp) files. Android also supports MPEG-4 Simple Profile in 3GP files
   (.3gp) as well as H.264.
   H.264 is also referred to as MPEG-4 part 10 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding). It is one
   of the contenders for the video codec crown and probably offers the widest amount of
   support across software and hardware. H.264 is supported by Silverlight, Flash,
   iPhone/iPod, Blu-ray devices, and so on. Android supports H.264 encoded video in the
   MPEG-4 container format (.mp4)


   Android probably also supports WebMobil
   (Android 3.0 and later), the open and royalty-free media container that holds VP8-
   encoded video and Vorbis-encoded audio. WebM was introduced shortly after Google
   acquired On2 Technologies and released the VP8 codec into the public domain.
