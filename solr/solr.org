** Lucene

  Lucene, the underlying engine is Apache Lucene, the core technology
  underlying it.

  - Lucene is a high performance text search engine library

  The major features in lucene are 

  - A text-based inverted index persistance storage for efficient
    retrievel of documents by indexed terms

  - A rich set of text analysers to tranform a string of text into a
    series of stream, which are the fundamental units indexed and
    search

  - A query syntax with a parser and a variety of query types from a
    simple term lookup to exotic fuzzy matches

  - A good scoring algorithm based on sound Information Retrieval (IR)
    principles to produce the more likely candidates first, with flexible means
    to affect the scoring
    
   - A highlighter feature to show words found in context

   - A query spellchecker based on indexed content


** Solr, The Server-ization of Lucene.

   Most Solr's features are distinct from Lucene, such a faceting, but
   not far into the implementation.

   - HTTP request processing for indexing and quering documents.
   - Several caches for faster query  process
   - A web-based administrative interface including:
     - Run time performance statistics inclduing cache hit/miss
     - a query form to search the index    
     - a scheme browser with histograms of popular terms along with
       some statistics
     - Details breakdown of breakdown of scoring mathematics and text
       analysis phase
   - Configuration files
