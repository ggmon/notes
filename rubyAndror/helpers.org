* Building your own Helpers

The basic idea of helper is to use modules, modules can be  used to
mix in new methods and functionality to an existing class. Infact if
we look within our /app directory, It already contains a helper
subdirectory which contains default helper. When Rails goes to render
our template, it mixes in the appropriate  helper modules.

We can add a new helper methods eaisly by simply adding the
appropriate methods to this module


module ApplicationHelper
  def show_avatar
    if @user.avatar
      @user.avatar.public_filename
    else
      "no_avatar.gif"
    end
  end
end



and within our view templates, anytime we wanted to display a user's
avatar, we could do so with a simple call to this


<%= img_tag show_avatar %>
