** Converting Between Types

In ruby everything is an object, absolutely everything around is an
object: an instance of a class. Also the rigidness that comes with
statically typed language is rigid. For example, the #puts method will
accept any object which responds to a #to_s method call. This type of
behaviour is called duck typing

*** Number from a string

String_i scans the literal value of the object and returns the value
as an Integer. Similary String_f scans the literal value of an object
and returns the value as a Float.
