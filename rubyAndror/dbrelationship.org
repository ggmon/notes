* Defining Relationship Between Objects


  The primary types of database associations are 
  - one-to-one associations
  - one-to-many associations
  - many-to-many associations

** Some examples

   - An author can have one weblog
   
   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_one :weblog
   end

   - An author can submit many stories
   
   class Author < ActiveRecordd::Base
      has_many :stories
   end       

   - A story belongs to an author

   class Story < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :author
   end

   - A story has and belongs to many, different topics
   
   class Story < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_and_belongs_to_many :topics
   end
        
   class  Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_and_belongs_to_many :stories
   end
