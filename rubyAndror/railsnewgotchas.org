** rails 2 and  broken render_text

Looks like that in Rails 2, in addition to changing the default
database, default sessions store, now some of the oldies such as
render_text method no longer work as expected. If you’ve used
render_text "some text" in a controller, then you’ll need to replace
it with render :text => "some text".
