  Cucumber, Rspec, WebRat and Factory Girl

  WebRat depends on Nokogiri

* For cucumber to be working with rails

  ruby  script/generate cucumber

  

** Issues I had
   
   When I had set up all the scenarios and steps and run "rake cucumber"
   I got some error sayinig
   
   " thread tried to join itself  in eval visit"

   after googling i got this link https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3153
   and they had a patch which I applied, which solved the issue
