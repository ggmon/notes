* REST - representational state transfer.

Is a style of software architecture or distributed hypermedia systems such as
World Wide Web.

REST strictly refers to a collection of network architecture principle
which outline how resources are defined and addressed. The term is
often used in a lesser sense to describe any simple interface which
transmits domain-specific data over HTTP without additional messaging
layer such as SOAP or session tracking via HTTP cookies.
